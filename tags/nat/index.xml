&lt;h2 id="private-ip-addresses">Private IP Addresses&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A private IP address it used for communication within the same local network and is not routable over the public Internet. These IPs are typically assigned by a DHCP server within the local network, and&amp;ndash;like any IP address&amp;ndash;must be unique within the network to allow proper communication between devices
To allow devices with private IP addresses to access the Internet, the router that connects the network to the Internet must perform Network Address Translation (NAT).
The IPv4 address ranges reserved for private networks are defined by RFC 1918. In most environments, one of these private subnets is selected and assigned to all internal devices. In IPv4 networks, it is strongly recommended to use an RFC 1918 private subnet together with NAT to enable Internet access from internal hosts.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
